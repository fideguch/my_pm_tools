# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Cursor-based pagination for `list-items` and `sprint-report` (MAX_PAGES=20 guard)
- `PageInfo` interface in type definitions
- Type guard functions: `hasField`, `isSelectValue`, `isNumberValue`, `isIterationValue`
- 10 scenario tests (`tests/scenarios/pm-workflows.spec.ts`) with Given-When-Then
- `QUICKSTART.md` — 3-step installation guide
- `examples/` directory with 4 example docs (setup, daily, analytics, MCP)

### Changed

- `GET_PROJECT_FULL` query now accepts `$cursor` parameter for pagination
- `sprint-report.ts` and `list-items.ts` paginate through all items automatically
- Test suite split: `skill-structure.spec.ts` (1,726 lines) → `tests/skill/{structure,content,validation}.spec.ts`
- Unsafe `as` casts reduced from 9 to 1 (justified: dynamic GraphQL response in `add-item.ts`)

### Fixed

- Projects with 200+ items no longer truncate results silently
- Added try/catch to sprint-report pagination loop for error resilience
